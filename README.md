# Squares
Hello... This is a tool used to create levels from text files based on the Unity3d game engine.

To test it out, use these to create your own custom level

* 0 - empty cell
* 1 - normal wall
* P - Player
* D - Wall that can move down
* U - Wall that can move up
* L - Wall that can move left
* R - Wall that can move right
* X - purple cell
* # - denotes end of the line

Some samples are located in the Assets/Resources folder

## Custom Use

To use this tool for your own game, you have to edit the Assets/Scripts/Controller.cs file to suite the things you level will be generating...
Create a new issue if you need any help :D :).

## The road ahead...

1. make it generic (so people won't have to edit the code to use it)
2. make it work for 3D
3. make it work with other grid types (triangle, heptagon, hexagon and n-gon grids)
